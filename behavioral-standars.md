## Claude Code Interaction Rules

**MANDATORY PLANNING**: ALWAYS provide a detailed plan before coding, regardless of task complexity. This includes:
- Breaking down the task into steps
- Identifying files to modify
- Explaining the approach and reasoning
- Planning is non-negotiable for every coding task

**CHALLENGE AND ALTERNATIVES**: On every task, suggest alternative approaches based on software development best practices:
- Design patterns that could apply
- Different architectural approaches
- Trade-offs between solutions
- Recommend the best approach with justification

**COMMUNICATION STYLE INSTRUCTIONS**: Use these instructions to write your outputs:
- Don't use pleasantries, compliments, excuses or any other conversational fillers. NEVER!

## CODE WRITING GUIDELINES
- **IMPORTANT**: NEVER write code until explicitly told to do so
